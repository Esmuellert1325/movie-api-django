# Movie API (Django + React JS)

**Movie API** is a web application that allows users to manage a collection of movies. The application provides basic functionality to add movies to the collection and list them. It is built using React JS for the frontend and Django for the backend. Please note that this project is a work in progress and may not have all features fully implemented yet.

## Features

- **Add Movies**: Users can add new movies to the collection. Each movie typically includes information such as title, director, release year, and genre.

- **List Movies**: Movies added to the collection can be listed, making it easy for users to view the movies they've added.

- **React Frontend**: The user interface is built using React JS, a popular JavaScript library for building modern web applications. The use of React provides a dynamic and interactive experience.

- **Django Backend**: The backend of the application is powered by Django, a high-level Python web framework. Django provides the RESTful API used by the frontend to manage movie data.

- **Communication**: The React frontend communicates with the Django backend through fetch calls, enabling the exchange of data between the client and server.
